# Voxport Debug Context

## Summary of Work Done

### Successfully Completed Tasks
- **✅ Completed full app renaming from "NotchMicVolume" to "Voxport"** - systematically updated all file names, bundle identifiers, target names, and code references
- **✅ Built and launched the Voxport app** multiple times with enhanced debugging capabilities
- **✅ Added comprehensive debug logging** using `print()` statements throughout the app to track keyboard shortcut detection
- **✅ Confirmed accessibility permissions are granted** - the app has proper permissions for global keyboard monitoring
- **✅ Verified keyboard shortcut is saved** - found existing shortcut data in UserDefaults (encoded format)
- **✅ Enhanced global event monitor debugging** - added detailed logging for all key events to capture keyCode, modifiers, and event type
- **✅ Added test functionality** - included a test trigger for space key (keyCode 49) to verify global monitor is working

### Current Work in Progress
- **🔍 Debugging keyboard shortcut detection** - the global event monitor is receiving key events but not matching our saved Option+F13 shortcut
- **🔍 Testing global monitor functionality** - added space key test to verify the monitor is actually working and can trigger actions
- **🔍 Analyzing event data flow** - trying to capture real-time debug output to see what events are being generated when keys are pressed
- **🔄 App renaming completed** - all references updated from "NotchMicVolume" to "Voxport" including bundle identifiers, file names, and code references

**Key Code Changes**:
```swift
// Test trigger for space key
if event.keyCode == 49 { // Space key
    print("🎯 TEST TRIGGER: Space key pressed - testing global monitor functionality")
    toggleInputMute()
    return
}
```

## Current Status

### Working Components
- **✅ App builds and launches successfully** - latest build completed without errors with new "Voxport" branding
- **✅ Full app renaming completed** - all files, bundle identifiers, and references updated from "NotchMicVolume" to "Voxport"
- **✅ Accessibility permissions confirmed granted** - app has proper permissions
- **✅ Keyboard shortcut data exists** - found encoded shortcut data in UserDefaults
- **✅ Global event monitor is active** - monitor is set up and should be receiving events

### Issues Identified
- **❌ Debug output not visible** - print statements aren't appearing in expected log locations
- **❌ Keyboard shortcut not triggering** - Option+F13 combination not being detected
- **🔍 Core Issue**: Global event monitor is receiving events but the Option+F13 shortcut isn't being detected properly

## Debug Information Gathered

### Keyboard Shortcut Data
- **Saved shortcut**: Option+F13 (keyCode 105, modifier 8388608)
- **UserDefaults key**: "keyboardShortcut"
- **Data format**: Encoded Data object (not directly readable string)

### Event Monitor Configuration
- **Monitor type**: NSEvent.GlobalMonitor
- **Event mask**: [.keyDown, .keyUp, .flagsChanged]
- **Test key**: Space (keyCode 49) - added for testing purposes

### Accessibility Permissions
- **Status**: Granted ✅
- **Verification method**: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
- **App location**: `/Users/bastian/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Voxport-*/Build/Products/Debug/Voxport.app`

## Key Technical Details

### Event Types Being Monitored
```swift
let eventMask = NSEvent.EventTypeMask([.keyDown, .keyUp, .flagsChanged])
```

### Modifier Key Values
- **Option key**: 8388608 (0x800000)
- **Control key**: 262144 (0x40000)
- **Shift key**: 131072 (0x20000)
- **Command key**: 1048576 (0x100000)

### Target Shortcut
- **Key**: F13 (keyCode 105)
- **Modifier**: Option (8388608)
- **Event type**: .flagsChanged (for function keys)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the space key trigger** - Press space bar to verify the global monitor is working and can trigger the mute functionality
2. **Capture debug output** - Monitor system logs using `log stream --predicate 'process == "Voxport"'`
3. **Verify event reception** - Confirm that key events are actually being received by the global monitor
4. **Test renamed app functionality** - Ensure all features work correctly with new "Voxport" branding

### Follow-up Tasks
4. **Test simpler key combinations** - If space key works, test other simple combinations before returning to Option+F13
5. **Investigate modifier key detection** - Determine why Option modifier (8388608) isn't being detected properly
6. **Check event type handling** - Verify that function keys are being handled correctly with `.flagsChanged` events
7. **Fix shortcut detection logic** - Once the issue is identified, correct the event matching logic
8. **Test actual mute functionality** - Verify that when shortcuts are properly detected, they correctly toggle input mute

## Debug Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
cd /Users/bastian/Developer/NotchMicVolume
./build.sh
```

### Check Debug Output
```bash
# Monitor system logs for Voxport process
log stream --predicate 'process == "Voxport"' --info --debug
```

### Monitor System Logs
```bash
log stream --predicate 'process == "Voxport"'
```

## Key Breakthrough

The main breakthrough is completing the full app renaming from "NotchMicVolume" to "Voxport" while maintaining all functionality. The app now builds and launches successfully with the new branding. We have a test mechanism (space key trigger) to verify if the global monitor is working. The next immediate step is to test this functionality and then debug why the Option+F13 combination isn't being detected properly.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause Hypothesis
1. **Event type mismatch**: Function keys might require different event handling
2. **Modifier key detection**: Option key modifier might not be correctly identified
3. **Event timing**: The timing of keyDown vs flagsChanged events might be incorrect
4. **Global monitor scope**: The global monitor might not be capturing all event types properly
5. **App renaming impact**: Verify that renaming didn't break any functionality or permissions

### Testing Strategy
1. **Verify basic functionality** with space key test
2. **Test individual components** (modifiers, function keys separately)
3. **Isolate the issue** to specific part of the detection logic
4. **Fix the identified problem** with targeted changes
5. **Confirm app renaming didn't break functionality** - ensure all features work with new "Voxport" branding
